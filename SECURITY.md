## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may report a serious security vulnerability to us via [help@iron.security](mailto:help@iron.security?subject=security).
We will take a look as soon as possible and respond to you within the next business day.

In case you want to encrypt the disclosure details, you may do so after our response to your initial email since we use S/MIME.
